# My Trip FAQ

_Last update: Feb 9th, 2022_

## 1. When are you travelling to London?

I don't have a date yet. I'm still waiting for my UK VISA to come out.
Once the VISA is out, I'll be able to buy the plane ticket and will have a fixed start date.

## 2. Are you working remotely right now?

No. Remote is not an option at the moment. I'll only start working once I'm physically onboarded.

## 3. Are you joining as a Software Engineer?

I'm joining as an Android [Developer Relations Engineer](https://devrel.co/about/) on the Firebase Team.

## 4. Are you still leading GDG Maputo?

No. After 5 amazing years I have left the community in better hands, meet the [new organizers](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-maputo/#team-list).

## 5. Are you still a GDE?

At the moment, yes. But once I'm in London I will no longer be allowed to be a GDE and will be removed from the program.

## 6. Are you still a GitHub Star?

No. The GitHub Star program is renewed every year, and I could not renew it for 2022 because I've been away from the GitHub Community for some time. Maybe I'll do it again in 2023, who knows...

## 7. What about your University?

I spoke to the school directors who were very kind to let me finish my classes online.
