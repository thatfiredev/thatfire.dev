### Mozambique @ SSA GDG Summit in Lagos

#### Everything about the weekend I spent in Lagos attending the SSA GDG Summit 2017

The GDG SSA Community Summit 2017 is a conference that took place in Lagos (Nigeria) on September 22th. It gathered together 100 Google Developer Groups (GDG) organizers and 50 Women Tech Maker (WTM) leaders from [Sub-Saharan Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa). As a Google Developers Group organizer (for [GDG Maputo](https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Maputo/)), I have been invited to attend the Summit and I gladly accepted the invite.

I was very excited to attend this event since it was the first summit I attended as a GDG Organizer and it was also the first time I visited Nigeria. (_since we’re talking about first times, I’ll let it be clear that this is also my first blog post in English, so I apologize for any grammatical errors_).

I decided to write this blog post to answer these [FAQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAQ)s:

> How was the trip?

> How was the Summit?

> How did you like Lagos?

So let’s go through the whole journey.

### Day 1 (thursday 21/09) — The Trip ✈️

Maputo International Airport’s Entrance

The day started early as I had to travel on connected flights (Maputo — Johannesburg — Lagos). I left Maputo at around 11am and arrived in Johannesburg an hour later. Then 3 hours later I had to get a 5-hour flight.

Touched down in Lagos at night and even before leaving the plane I met the amazing [Kudzai Chasinda](https://medium.com/u/26410dc5fc51) ([GDG Harare Institute of Technology](https://developers.google.com/groups/chapter/117128802435887469950/)) who was with his great compatriot [Andrew Sithole](https://medium.com/u/ec0c456908be). And when we were leaving the airport I also met this beautiful woman named [Rachael Orumor](https://medium.com/u/f4557bfce8f5) (WTM Benin) and found out that there were more GDG leads from neighboring countries that came on the same flight.

After the introductions were made, we left to a restaurant (Jevinik Place) to have dinner (and to network with the other organizers)… When it was time to order, me and Kudzai (aka Kudzie Chase) could only think of one thing: [Jollof Rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jollof_rice) ✨. And that’s because it is a famous Nigerian dish (Thank you [Osvaldo Maria](https://medium.com/u/e13b54118dfc) for the reference 😃). Sadly, they were out of Jollof (the early GDGs and WTMs probably ordered it all) so we had some coconut rice instead 😓. We also tried (for the first time) a fruit named plantain and loved it. For those of you who never had plantain, let me give you Kudzie’s description:

> “Tastes like something between a potato and a sweet potato. I love it”

After the nice meal we left to our hotel (the Sojourner) to get some sleep (_extremely important after spending 6h flying_) since the Summit was on the following day. Each hotel room was booked for 2 GDG organizers, so that’s when I met my roommate (and now friend) [Anthony Limo](https://medium.com/u/d318658bf018) ([GDG Kabarak](https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Kabarak/)).

### Day 2 (friday 22/09) — The Summit 🔥

We left our hotel at 7:30 am and headed to the hotel where the event was taking place (The Renaissance Hotel) to have breakfast. Apparently, there was some delay with the breakfast so we took that time to network. I, personally, met so many people that I can’t even remember all of the names (_it’s not easy to remember more than 50 names in a single day_).

And just like in every Google Event we got free swag: T-shirts, notepads, pens and bags. 🎉

When at the conference room, we have been amazed with inspiring talks and stories from other GDGs, GDEs, GDG Veterans and other Google members. Some of my favorite ones were: Fund Raising (by Hanson Johnson), Diversity (Dorcas Owinoh), Community Impact(Roina Ochieng), GDG Best Practices (Sharon Ud Georgewill), Android Learning Community (Alimi Eyitayo) and Community Development Essentials (Babajide Duroshola).
