### Firebase News: April 19th — 25th

#### The Hello World

This is Article 01 of “Firebase News” - a series of articles where you can find the most recent news from the Firebase World. A new article will be posted every 1–2weeks discussing (most of) the changes made on the official tools, SDKs, sample apps and some of the 3rd party libraries. Also expect to see what’s new on: the [official Firebase blog](https://firebase.googleblog.com/), the [Firebase Developers Medium publication](https://medium.com/firebase-developers), the [Firebase Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Firebase/) and the [Firebase Open Source site](https://firebaseopensource.com/).
