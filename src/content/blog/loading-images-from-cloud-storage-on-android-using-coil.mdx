If you’re developing an Android app and you’re storing images in cloud storage for Firebase to later display in your app, you’re probably using an image loading library such as [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide), [Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso), [Fresco](https://github.com/facebook/fresco), or [firebase-ui-storage](https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-Android/blob/master/storage/README.md). Yes, these libraries can do the job, but what if I told you there’s a more pleasant and efficient way?

In this article, I’ll introduce you to the new kid in town, [**Coil**](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/)**,** and I’ll show you how to use it to load your cloud storage images with less boilerplate code.  
I’ll assume you’re already familiar with cloud storage for Firebase and already know how to use it in an Android app. If not, you may want to take a look at the [Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage).
