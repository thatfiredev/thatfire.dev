			<h3>ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!</h3>
			<p>
				My name is {SITE_AUTHOR}, and I'm currently working at Google as a Developer Relations Engineer
				on the <a href="http://firebase.google.com">Firebase</a> team in London ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§.
			</p>
			<p>
				I was born in Maputo ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¿ and have lived there for most of my life, where I worked as an
				Android app developer who later got some interest in Flutter as well.
			</p>
			<h4>Current Projects</h4>
			<p>
				Nowadays I have been focusing on making sure that
				<a href="http://firebase.google.com/products/vertex-ai-in-firebase">Vertex AI in Firebase</a> and
				<a href="http://firebase.google.com/products/data-connect">Firebase Data Connect</a>
				can provide a great Developer Experience for mobile developers.
			</p>
			<h4>Open Source</h4>
			<p>
				Most of the projects I work on are Open Source. You can find out
				more about them on <a href="https://github.com/thatfiredev" target="_blank">my GitHub profile</a>
